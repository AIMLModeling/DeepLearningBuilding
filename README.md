# Deep learning and neural networks with Python

Deep learning is a type of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that imitates the way humans gain certain types of knowledge.
Deep learning is an important element of data science, which includes statistics and predictive modeling.
Neural networks are computing systems with interconnected nodes that work much like neurons in the human brain.
I clarified the differences among Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning.
Then I demonstrated how to build a neural network or a deep learning model with Python.
